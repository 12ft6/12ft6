- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @12ft6 Or also known as Jeff.
-  Iâ€™m currently 20 years old and in the process of relearning minecraft plugin & client development.
-  I mostly am learning how to make Skyblock, skywars, factions (both regular factions and HCF) and bedwars plugins along with relearning anticheat development.
-  In the future I plan to release PvP clients (Like Badlion, Lunar, Zonix etc.) and eventually make open sourced ones for anyone to use to learn on or build your own.
-  I plan to release plugins for sale to buyers in the discord or even on MC-Market or SpigotMC.
-  I do NOT plan to be a server developer for hire. All my services will be shown on my own server when it's released.

// The best way to get into contact with me is through my development discord! I will be updating this as time goes by to give more information of what I plan to do and what
I am currently doing at that point of time. //
